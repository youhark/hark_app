Feature: Invitations
  In order to send and accept invitations
  As administrators and users
  I need an invite system

  @javascript
  Scenario: An admin sends an invitation
    Given There is a user "jason@email.com"
#    And user "jason@email.com" is an Admin
#    And I login with "jason@email.com"
#    And I click the link "invite user"
#    Then I should be at the page "/onboard/new"
#    When I fill in field "email" with "beta-request@email.com"
#    And press "send"
#    Then an email is sent to "beta-request@email.com"
#    And an invitation is created with slug "3243as3"
#    And the email contains
#  """
#  Welcome to Hark! You're invitation is now ready!
#  <a href="www.youhark.com/onboard/3243as3">Sign up here</a>
#  """
